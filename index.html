    <h3>Purpose of This Research</h3>
    <p>
      We want to extract device-specific features from motion sensors in VR
      headsets. Those features can be used to do user identification,
      fingerprinting of devices, and behavior profiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are expected to have one of Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, or Meta Quest
      3s. Any other types of VR headsets are not supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each device is allowed to participate only once. Multiple attempts will
      result in rejection.
    </p>

    <h3>Steps to Collect Your IMU Data</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Please make sure your device is connected to Wi-Fi during the
        experiment.
      </li>
      <!--<li>Please make sure your device's volume is set to the maximum.</li>-->
      <li>
        Please make sure your device is on a separate table without any laptops,
        speakers, or anything else that could cause vibrations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please make sure your Display-off time is set to at least 15 minutes.
        (Library -> Settings -> General -> Power -> Display off)
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable the Developer Mode of your headset using the Meta Horizon app on
        your smartphone (Meta Horizon app -> Device (Upper left corner) ->
        Headset Settings -> Developer Mode)
      </li>
      <li>

          >VRSensorLog.apk</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Meta Horizon Store, search and install the Mobile VR Station.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open Mobile VR Station -> Allow Permissions -> Click continue at the
        bottom -> Configuration Wizard -> Show All Options -> Configure Manage
        All Files -> Open Files All -> Locate VRSensorLog.apk -> Settings ->
        Allow from this source -> Install
      </li>
      <li>
        Open “AndroidSensorLog” from the Mobile VR Station on your headset.
